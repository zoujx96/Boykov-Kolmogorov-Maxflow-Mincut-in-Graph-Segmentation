# Boykov-Kolmogorov-Maxflow-Mincut-in-Graph-Segmentation
Implement Boykov-Kolmogorov Algorithm in Graph Segmentation to Find Mincut

To run the code, it is required to first type in the number of vertexes and edges, and then the information about the directed graph.
As an example, you can type in:  
20 35  
1 2 4  
2 3 100  
1 4 1  
4 3 10  

The program will return the mincut found.
